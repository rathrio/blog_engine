**Another idea for a boring Sunday**

A simple web app that keeps track of all my physical game copies. (I know,
 a text file could easily serve that purpose.)

Features:

* Register games
* Who borrowed what?
* Personal Reviews / Notes
* Wish list
* Group | Search by
  * Platform
  * Played
  * Genre
  * Borrowed

**Nice to have**

Native IOS App.

**Tech**

* Rails 4 + Postgres + Bootstrap | Foundation
* Node.js with some js frontent
* Rubymotion (for ios app)
