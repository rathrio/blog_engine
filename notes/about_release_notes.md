title: I. About Release Notes

We use [Github](http://www.github.com) to host our remote git repository.
Everytime we deploy a version of Bliss that we consider to be a minor (or
not so minor) release, we create a [release](https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software) on Github.

A release note __must__ have

* a __list of things that changed__
* a bad movie-like __title__ that is somewhat relevant to the changes
* a __banner picture__ that is somewhat relevant to the title
* a reference to a [__tag__](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging)

Additional comments are optional.

The purpose of release notes is to keep track of our bigger milestones
and to provide an opportunity to show off our fabulous image editing skills.

The following screenshot shows an example release note for a version of Bliss that
includes a lot of features and fixes demanded by Chief Operating Officer Kevin:
