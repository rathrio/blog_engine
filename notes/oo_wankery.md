It is also not true that I don't like to argue OO technique. I fucking LOVE to argue coding techniques of all kind. What I don't like to do, though, is to argue technique outside the realm of looking at real code. Let's have an argument alright, but let's base it off code examples. Before/after and all that jazz.

I've found that's the only way to keep a calibrated bullshit meter. There is so much WANKERY (I know you guys love that term ;)) in the world of software when people are left to just talk technique in the abstract. We're overburdened and, frankly, oppressed by the pontifications of "architects".
