The Bliss Manifesto is a series of insights on coding my dear friend
[Fützgü](https://github.com/jugglinghobo) and I gained while working on a
project called Bliss. It primarily serves as a collection of notes
and guidelines on Software Development for us and our coworkers at
[Fadendaten](http://www.fadendaten.ch). It furthermore provides some information
about how we generally do things in Bliss.

Most of Bliss consists of a Rails application, so a lot of our points are about
programming in Ruby, Rails, Javascript and so forth, but we will also try to write
about everyday coding and working in a team.

At the time of writing, we have been developing Bliss for about two years and are
accordingly inexperienced. Our points may seem very unprofessional and highly
opinionated. They are to be taken with a grain of salt.
