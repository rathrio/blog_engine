When writing documentation of all kind, it's always a good idea to answer the
question "Why?", because in our experience, that's the question that gets asked
the most when trying to understand a piece of code.

You're writing a commit message where the motives of the changes are not
implicit? Just answer the question "Why were these changes necessary?".

You're writing some documentation to a method and other developers might
question the need for this method? Answer the question "Why does this method
exist and in what scenario is it most commonly used?".

As simple as that. It's probably a matter of common sense to most of you, but
it's still a rarity in Bliss.
