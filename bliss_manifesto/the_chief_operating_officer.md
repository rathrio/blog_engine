Kevin is to be referred to as [Chief Operating Officer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer) Kevin.
As simple as that.  We don't want to see any references of him without the prefix _Chief Operating Officer_.
The abbreviation _COO_ does __not__ count as a valid replacement for _Chief
Operating Officer_.

These rules apply to anything that is displayed on the [Bliss Github Repository](https://github.com/fadendaten/bliss), i.e. code, issues etc.

Variations of his name however are allowed and very welcome:

* Chief Operating Officer Kev
* Chief Operating Officer Kevä
* Chief Operating Officer Kaaschte
* Chief Operating Officer Kev le Chef
* Chief Operating Officer Kellog's Special K™
